robochecker: This is lightweight tool meant to be given to students. This verifies that the students name their files
    correctly, have included all their sources, etc. It can also run some test cases.

robograder: This is the automated grading tool that takes a rubric and produces a score.

CAVEAT: This tool is not secure, since it runs a students solution on your machine directly (through python's subprocess module).
Thus, it is running untrusted code without sandboxing, so you should be careful.
