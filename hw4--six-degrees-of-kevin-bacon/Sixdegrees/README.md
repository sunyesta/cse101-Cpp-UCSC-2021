## Usage

### Input Format
Each line of the input file will be like this:
`<ACTOR1> <ACTOR2>`

##### Running

    $ sixdegrees <input file> <output file>

### Output Format


• If either <ACTOR1> or <ACTOR2> are not present in the data (meaning there is no movie with them), outputs “Not present”.

• If there is no path between <ACTOR1> or <ACTOR2>, outputs “Not
present”.

• If <ACTOR1> is the same as <ACTOR2>, just prints <ACTOR1>

• (The real case) Prints a shortest path between the actors, with the movie
connecting adjacent actors. For example:

James Franco -(Love Conquers All: The Making of Tristan + Isolde)- Jim Lemley
-(Through the Eyes of Director Timur Bekmambetov)- Thomas Kretschmann
-(Prince Valiant)- Katherine Heigl
