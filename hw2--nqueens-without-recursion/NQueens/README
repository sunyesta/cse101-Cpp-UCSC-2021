# HW2: nQueens Without Recursion

Fills a board with 'n' queens where 'n' is the size of the board. (width or length, they are both the same.) The user may also fill the board with their own queens and use the program to determine the location of the remaining queens.

## Usage

### Input Format
line seperated list of format:
`<board size> <queen1 row> <queen1 col> <queen2 row> <queen2 col> ... <queen_k row> <queen_k col>`
Note: rows and cols are indexed from 1, not 0.
so that the file may look something like this:
```
4 1 2 4 3
3 1 1
4 1 1
```

In this example, there are 3 boards of sizes 4, 3, and 4 respectivley.
 
The first row shows that the first board has 2 queens in locations (row=1, col=2) and (row=4, col=3)
##### Running

    $ nqueens <input file> <output file>

### Output Format
for the above example, the output is as follows
```
1 2 2 4 3 1 4 3 
No solution
No solution
```
The first line shows the solution for the first board. It contains queens at locations (1,2), (2,4), (4,3)

the other 2 boards have no solution.
